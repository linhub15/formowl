### Error when returning non-serializable data from `createServerFn`

When querying complex data from a serverFn, like `jsonb` the handler will throw
an error that's not clear. You will need to type cast the data, or map it to a 
serializable format before returning it to the client.

#### Solution / workaround

Add a type to `jsonb` columns.

```ts
jsonb("column_name").$type<Record<string, any>>();
```
